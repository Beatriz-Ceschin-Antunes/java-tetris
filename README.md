Project created as an assignment for the class SWENG 311 Object-Oriented Design during the Fall 2024 semester.

# Tetris
The Tetris game is a one-player game in which the player must use four block shapes that drop from the top of the screen to fill rows. The longer the player can avoid the board from filling up, the higher the user's score will be.

## What I learned
- To write programs using encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance in Java.
- To efficiently manipulate 2D arrays that represented the game board.
